      Bangladesh has developed a lot in the sector of IT and software development industry. In last few decades there has been a significant improvement in this field and time has brought the recent outcome. It gains maturity with such improvement which was quite undesirable at a certain period. But not anymore it’s going to be ignored or avoided by its contribution in the national income. Day by day it is creating more scopes for employment along with playing a vital role in dispelling the unemployment problems of the young graduates.
 
      It’s one of the sectors which is bringing more and more new entrepreneurs. The number of young graduates starting their entrepreneurship in this sector is too damn high. Many of them returning to the country from abroad hoping for a better future in this sector. These enthusiastic young entrepreneurs are remarkably building sustainable business organizations through their hard work and passion. Their resilience are supposed to be the key force of Bangladesh IT industry. 

      A survey of BASIS shows that the number of registered software companies in Bangladesh are around 1200 or more than that. Although there is every single possibility to have more than hundred unregistered IT ventures for both local and global markets. Among these companies a few names are always uttered as the best software companies in Bangladesh. A study says that approximately 30,000 professionals are currently working in this IT sector and the industry size is estimated to be over US$ 250 million. Software & IT services industry is certainly one of the top graduate employment sectors in Bangladesh.

      Bangaladesh software industry is different because majority of our population is youth and they can contribute huge to software development industry. Living expenses are very moderate in Bangladesh that's why freelance developer can bid for lower Price for a work rather then developed countries.Thats why employer and business owner are very interested to give their works to Bangladesh. Its a win win situation for both developer and business owner.
